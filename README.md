Fourth-year psychology thesis on non-attachment

Non-attachment is a cognitive style in which an individual releases their mental fixations, or
‘attachments’, to acquiring wanted outcomes and desires. As such, it appears to be
psychologically advantageous. The present study examined the relationship between levels of
non-attachment and personal striving progress, and other striving characteristics. 

Participants were administered a survey comprising of a Personal Strivings Measure and the
Nonattachment Scale. Participants answered only part of the questionnaires, as the study used
a planned missing data design incorporating a multiple imputation procedure. Analyses
revealed a moderate correlation between striving progress and non-attachment. 

Non-attached individuals were also more likely to engage in authentic strivings, had more personally
important strivings and were less likely to engage in externally controlled strivings. Non-
attachment appears to have a positive impact on personal striving progress, but also on
healthy psychological functioning. It therefore warrants further research into future use in
psychological practice and patient education.
