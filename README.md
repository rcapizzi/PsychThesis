Fourth-year psychology thesis on non-attachment

Non-Attachment

Personal strivings can be understood as individuals life intentions or goals. Non-attachment is a 
cognitive style in which an individual releases their mental fixations, or ‘attachments’, to acquiring wanted 
outcomes and desires. As such, it appears to be psychologically advantageous. The present study examined the 
relationship between levels of non-attachment and personal striving progress, and other striving characteristics. 

Design

Participants were administered a survey comprising of a Personal Strivings Measure and the
Nonattachment Scale. Participants answered only part of the questionnaires, as the study used
a planned missing data design incorporating a multiple imputation procedure. Analyses using SPSS statistical procedures
revealed a moderate correlation between striving progress and non-attachment. 

Findings

Non-attached individuals were also more likely to engage in authentic strivings, had more personally
important strivings and were less likely to engage in externally controlled strivings. Non-
attachment appears to have a positive impact on personal striving progress, but also on
healthy psychological functioning. It therefore warrants further research into future use in
psychological practice and patient education.
